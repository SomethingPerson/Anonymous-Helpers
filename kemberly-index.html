      		<P>Do you know what bullying is? Mabey not well, getting bullied is when someone hurts you physically, verbaly, or mentally. But sometimes people are just being mean the diffrence is that if someone calles you ugly they can do in a playful way or in a rude way and if some one tells you "Go kill yourselve"(Please do not try to selfharm yourselves it is not worth it or a good idea don't listen to the people that tell you this.) or something along thoses lines then they are bulling you and you should tell a trusted adult, no matter what they tell you to try and convince you to not tell an adult.</P>
